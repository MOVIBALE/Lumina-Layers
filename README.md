Inspiration and Technical Statements

### Acknowledgements to Pioneers

This project owes its existence to the open sharing of the following technologies:

- **HueForge** - The first tool to introduce optical color mixing to the FDM community, demonstrating that layering transparent materials can achieve rich colors through light transmission.

- **AutoForge** - An automated color matching workflow, making multi-material color printing easy to use.

- **CMYK Printing Theory** - A layer-by-layer transmission adaptation of the classic subtractive color model in 3D printing.

### Technical Differentiation and Positioning

Traditional tools rely on theoretical calculations (such as TD1/TD0 transmission distance values), but these parameters are highly susceptible to failure due to various objective factors.

 **Lumina Studio employs an exhaustive search approach:**

1. Print a 1024-color physical calibration board (4 colors x 5 layers, full permutation)

2. Scan the board by photograph and extract the actual RGB data

3. Create a "LUT" (Learning Unknown Test Table)

4. Use a nearest neighbor algorithm for matching (similar to the matching in Bambulab's keychain generator).

### Prior Art Declaration

The core principle of FDM multilayer overlay was publicly disclosed by software such as HueForge between 2022 and 2023, and is considered **prior art**.

The HueForge authors have also clearly stated that this technology has entered the public domain, and in most countries and regions, if the patent office carefully examines it, a principle patent would certainly be rejected.

The pioneers have chosen to remain open to help the community develop; therefore, this technology is generally **not patentable**.

Lumina Studio will continue to maintain its open-source, collaborative, and non-profit positioning, and we welcome everyone's supervision.
Lumina Studio will continue to operate on an open-source, collaborative, and non-profit basis, and we welcome your feedback.

- This project is an open-source, non-profit project. There will be no bundled sales, and no features will be made into paid features.
- If you or your company wish to support the project's continued development, please contact us. Sponsored products will only be used for software development, testing, and optimization.
- Sponsorship represents support for the project only and does not constitute any commercial binding.
- We reject any sponsorship collaborations that could influence technical decisions or open-source licenses.

Lumina Studio did not refer to any patent applications because such patents usually only contain specifications and the technical code is not disclosed in the short term. Blindly referring to these patents would affect its own development process.

**Special thanks to the HueForge team for their support and understanding of open source!**  **

## Open Ecosystem

### About .npy Calibration Files

All calibration presets (`.npy` files) are **completely free and open**, adhering to the following principles:

- **No Vendor Lock-in:** We have never, currently, and will never force users to use specific consumable brands, nor will we require manufacturers to produce specific "compatible consumables" that meet our requirements. This violates the spirit of open source.

- **Community Collaboration:** We welcome all users, organizations, and consumable manufacturers to submit PRs and synchronize calibration presets. Your printer data can help others.

- No other testing tools are needed; all you need is a 3D printer and a mobile phone.

**Open Data = Democratization of Technology**

Lumina Studio v1.5.2 integrates three major modules into a unified interface:

### 📐 Module 1: Calibration Generator

Generates precision calibration boards to physically test filament mixing.

- **1024-Color Matrix**: Full permutation of 4 base filaments across 5 layers (0.4mm total)
- **Dual Color Modes**: Supports both CMYW (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow/White) and RYBW (Red/Yellow/Blue/White)
- **Face-Down Optimization**: Viewing surface prints directly on the build plate for a smooth finish
- **Solid Backing**: Automatically generates a 1.6mm opaque backing to ensure color consistency and structural rigidity
- **Anti-Overlap Geometry**: Applies 0.02mm micro-shrinkage to voxels to prevent slicer line-width conflicts

### 🎨 Module 2: Color Extractor

Digitizes the physical reality of your printer.

- **Computer Vision**: Perspective warp + lens distortion correction for automatic grid alignment
- **Mode-Aware Alignment**: Corner markers follow the correct color sequence based on your selected mode (CMYW vs RYBW)
- **Digital Twin**: Extracts RGB values from the print and generates a .npy LUT file
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Interactive probe tools allow manual verification/correction of specific color block readings (e.g., removing glare/shadows)

### 💎 Module 3: Image Converter

Converts images into printable 3D models using calibrated data.

- **KD-Tree Color Matching**: Maps image pixels to actual printable colors found in your LUT
- **Live 3D Preview**: Interactive WebGL preview with true matched colors—rotate, zoom, and inspect before printing
- **Keychain Loop Generator**: Automatically adds functional hanging loops with:
  - Smart color detection (matches nearby model colors)
  - Customizable dimensions (width, length, hole diameter)
  - Rectangle base + semicircle top + hollow hole geometry
  - 2D preview shows loop placement
- **Structure Options**: Double-sided (keychain) or Single-sided (relief) modes
- **Smart Background Removal**: Automatic transparency detection with adjustable tolerance
- **Correct 3MF Naming**: Objects are named by color (e.g., "Cyan", "Magenta") instead of "geometry_0" for easy slicer identification

### Previous Updates (v1.4)

### Three Modeling Modes

Lumina Studio v1.4 introduces **three distinct geometry generation engines** to cover everything from pixel art to photo-realistic details:

| Mode | Use Case | Technical Features | Precision |
|------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| 🎨 **Vector Mode** | Logos, illustrations, cartoons | Smooth curves, OpenCV contour extraction | 10 px/mm (0.1mm/pixel) |
| 🖼️ **Woodblock Mode** ⭐ | Photos, portraits, complex textures | SLIC superpixels + detail preservation | 10 px/mm  |
| 🧱 **Voxel Mode** | Pixel art, 8-bit style | Blocky geometry, nostalgic aesthetic | 2.4 px/mm (nozzle width) |

### Color Quantization Engine 

**"Cluster First, Match Second"**:

Traditional methods match 1 million pixels to LUT individually. v1.4 instead:
1. **K-Means Clustering**: Quantize image to K dominant colors (8-256, default 64)
2. **Match Only K Colors**: 1000× speed improvement
3. **Spatial Denoising**: Bilateral + median filtering eliminates fragmented regions

**User-Adjustable Parameters**:
- **Vector Color Detail** slider: 8 colors (minimalist) to 256 colors (photographic)

### Other Improvements

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📏 Resolution Decoupling | Vector/Woodblock: 10 px/mm, Voxel: 2.4 px/mm |
| 🎮 Smart 3D Preview Downsampling | Large models auto-simplify preview (3MF retains full quality) |
| 🚫 Browser Crash Protection | Detects model complexity, disables preview for 2M+ pixels |

**Previous Updates (v1.2-1.3)**:

## How It Works

### Why Calibration Matters

Theoretical TD values assume:
- Perfectly consistent filament dye concentration
- Identical nozzle temperatures across all materials
- Uniform layer adhesion

In reality, these vary significantly between:
- Different filament brands/batches
- Printer models and nozzle designs
- Environmental humidity and temperature

The LUT-based approach solves this by measuring actual printed colors and matching them via nearest-neighbor search in RGB space.
